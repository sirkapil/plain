**Disjoint Sets**: Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be two non-empty sets, We say $$A$$ and $$B$$ are disjoint if
<br /><center>$$ A \cap B = \phi$$
</center>
</div>
<div class="isa_info">
**Seperated Sets**: Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be two non-empty sets,We say sets $$A$$ and $$B$$ are seperated if following two conditions holds :<br />
<center>$$ A \cap \overline{B} = \phi$$ 
$$ \overline{A} \cap B = \phi$$
</center>
