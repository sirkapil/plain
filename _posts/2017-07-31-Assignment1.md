## Answer 1
Given Differential equation is :

$$ \sqrt{(1+ x^2 + y^2 + x^2 y^2)} dx + (x y) dy = 0 $$

taking $y^2$ common from $y^2 + x^2 y^2$.

$$ \sqrt{(1+ x^2) + y^2(1 + x^2)} dx + (xy) dy = 0 $$

taking $1+x^2$ common from $(1+ x^2) + y^2(1 + x^2)$

$$ \sqrt{(1+ x^2) (1 + y^2)} dx + (x y) dy = 0 $$

$$= \sqrt{1+ x^2} \sqrt{1 + y^2} dx + (x y) dy = 0 $$

or it can be written as

$$-(x y) dy = \sqrt{1+ x^2} \sqrt{1 + y^2} dx$$

or it can be written as

$$ \frac{-y}{\sqrt{1 + y^2}}dy = \frac{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}{x}dx$$

We have reduced the original differential equation into a variable separable equation and it can be easily solved by integrating both sides.  

$$\int \frac{-y}{\sqrt{1 + y^2}}dy = \int \frac{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}{x}dx$$

As we are using indefinite integral , so we need to introduce an arbitrary constant but for smooth calculations ,I'll introduce it directly in my answer.

<b>Solving LHS integral:</b>

$$\int \frac{-y}{\sqrt{1 + y^2}}dy$$ --- Eq(1)

assuming $1+y^2 = t$ then we'll have $$2y dy = dt \\  ydy = \frac{dt}{2}$$
putting value of $ydy$ into equation (1) ,we have

$$ =\int \frac{-dt}{\sqrt{t}} \\ =\int -t^{-1/2} dt \\=  -[\frac{t^{1/2}{1/2}] \\= -2 \sqrt{t}$$

Replacing $t$ by $1+y^2$ , we have

$$= -2 \sqrt{1+y^2}

<b>Solving RHS integral :</b> 

$$= \int \frac{\sqrt{1+ x^2}}{x}dx$$
